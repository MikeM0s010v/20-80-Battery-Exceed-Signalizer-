#20-80-Battery-Exceed-Signalizer-
Rough venv-python alarm for 20-80% battery rule. It simply reminds you to plug-unplug the power cable.  The programme starts as you login into your Linux user account..

Steps
1. Create venv folder. Put the python script and alarm wav-file in there.
2. Create a bash script that changes directory and runs the py-file.
3. Add modifications to your .bashrc-file.

Enjoy! LOL
